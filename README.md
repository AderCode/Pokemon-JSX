###Resume Edition

This is a personal side project of creating an interactive resume, and tell-tale of my time in the Covalence.io Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp, completely in ReactJS(JSX) told in the style of one of my favorite classic GameBoy games Pokémon. 

- Key features:
    - Attacks
        - Opponent (Covalence) attacks are key struggles that I had to learn to adapt to and overcome.
        - Player attacks are some of my personal favorite strengths used during challenging times at Covalence.

    - Run
        - You can not escape the stack!

    - Stats
        - A trainer card with information about myself and the essential languages that I use. 
        <!-- W.I.P. (Click the language icons at the bottom for more info on them) -->

    - Items
        - _currently a work-in-progress (WIP)_

Stay tuned for more to come!
